    `npm run build`

    `npm run deploy:production`
Builds a production version and places the compiled assets in a `dist` directory at the root of the project. The project will then be deployed to Now(now.sh). 

If you try to run it, it will likely ask you to log in or create an
account. This can be done at:
https://zeit.co/now

Once setup, this command will deploy the project to a URL like
https://dnaviewer.pendulum.now.sh/
